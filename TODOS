- how to handle default values for state? (class instead of interface? where to initialize it? should it have public API methods?)

- handle styles for components - ORIENTATION, tabs, etc.
- how to handle using class (with default values) instead of interface ??
- how to handle active state? (should I handle active item or activeChildren)
- handle traversing al active children & triggering refresh/resize event on them?

- add (nested) D&D mechanism - start with the easiest version
